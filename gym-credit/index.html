      How do I register for gym credit?
    </h5>

  <p>
    The gym credit classes on Workday are limited in size and tend to fill up very quickly during class registration. We recommend registering for the desired semester as soon as possible. To register, click on find course section in Workday and search by <b>Fall or Spring semester</b>, <u>not by term.</u>&nbsp;Once you reach the search page, you can type in WPE 1221 and add it to a saved schedule or start registration if eligible.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Please only register for the class if you know you can make the commitment to getting 21 runs. Otherwise you will get an NR and take up a spot that another runner could have used.</em>
  </p>
<hr class="separator separator--long-line" />

    <h5 id="what-events-count-for-gym-credit">
      What events count for gym credit?
    </h5>

  <p>
    Almost every event that we organize counts for credit! Any run, Fun Friday, or volunteer opportunity can be counted for credit. However, any races we attend can't be counted for credit.
  </p>
<hr class="separator separator--long-line" />

    <h5 id="what-are-the-requirements-to-get-gym-credit">
      What are the requirements to get gym credit?
    </h5>

  <p>
    You must attend at least 21 runs or events during the registered semester (Fall A&amp;B terms or Spring C&amp;D terms) to get credit for the class. Anyone with less than 21 runs will receive an NR for the class.&nbsp;We also expect everyone to complete or put forth your best effort at runs in order to get credit for the day.
  </p>

  <p>
    We offer at least 3-6 runs a week so with proper planning getting credit should be easy! Please remember to bring your ID to any run to get credit for the day!
  </p>
<hr class="separator separator--long-line" />

    <h5 id="how-do-i-check-my-current-number-of-runs">
      How do I check my current number of runs?
    </h5>

  <p>
    After the first few weeks of the term, we will send out emails with your current status. Every email also includes a link to a spreadsheet that is always updated with your run totals. On the spreadsheet, you can also see which days you got credit for. As always, you can also ask any run leader or exec member if you want to check.
  </p>
<hr class="separator separator--long-line" />

    <h5 id="what-if-i-cant-dont-reach-21-runs">
      What if I can't / don't reach 21 runs?
    </h5>

  <p>
    If you have less than 21 runs, you will receive an NR for the class. We are unable to allow runs completed on your own to count for credit or any activity that is not one of our scheduled runs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>There are no exceptions to this rule.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    We also expect everyone to complete or put forth your best effort at runs in order to get credit for the day.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>This goes without saying but anyone who attempts to get credit on a day when they did not run will automatically receive an NR and be reported to the club sports office.</em>
  </p>
<hr class="separator separator--long-line" />

    <h5 id="how-to-i-get-credit-for-the-day">
      How to I get credit for the day?
    </h5>

  <p>
    At the end of each run or event, run leaders or execs will collect attendance. Please make sure to bring your WPI ID since we scan the barcodes on the back to track attendance.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </p>
<hr class="separator separator--long-line" />

    <h5 id="what-if-i-forget-to-get-credit-when-i-went-to-a-run">
      What if I forget to get credit when I went to a run?
    </h5>

  <p>
    If you realize that you forgot to scan your ID at a run, send the VP an email as soon as possible. Please include proof of the run (Strava, Garmin, Apple Watch, MapMyRun, etc) if you have it to make the process easier.&nbsp;
